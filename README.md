# KeepNumLkOn
For whatever reason my laptop randomly turns NumLk off. Google didn't find a working solution.
Since I don't look at the keyboard while typing I don't notice NumLk is off which causes wrong passwords, missing numbers and other anoying things.
So this is probably the most useful 13 lines of Python I ever wrote for myself.
